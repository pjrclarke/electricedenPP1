# Electric Eden
Electric Edens site is expressly dedicated to the fan base to help them find ways to download their latest music, find out the live dates and get in contact with any requests, queries and bookings. It'll target the people who already know who the band are and give them opportunity to find out more relevant information.

## Features


__Navigation Bar__
 
 
- The navigation bar is fixed to the top each of the pages regardless if you scroll or not, giving the user quick, easy access to select the page they want. 
- On the left we have the navigational menu. When hovering over a particular page name, the text is shadowed to help the user see which page they are about to select. 
- On the right, we have the band logo that when selected will take you back to the home page. 
- The colours are partially matched to the imagery to give that consistent feel across the site.
