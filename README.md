# Electric Eden #
Electric Edens site is expressly dedicated to the fan base to help them find ways to download their latest music, find out the live dates and get in contact with any requests, queries and bookings. It'll target the people who already know who the band is and give them an opportunity to find out more relevant information.

This is the best place to discover and immerse yourself in <a href = https://pjrclarke.github.io/electricedenPP1/index.html>Electric Eden</a>.

# Wireframes #

The Wireframes for the Electric Eden website were made on [Balsamiq](https://www.balsamiq.cloud). The images below show the display on a full size browser as well as a smaller handheld device. There are slight differences on the real site due to what I considered to be a better user experience. 

![Wireframes Desktop](Readme_Img/readme_wireframe_website.png)

The mobile screen offers a more vertical design, stacking elements and ensuring that the user experience isn't hindered by a screen width.

# Site Structure #

Electric Eden has four pages. [Home](index.html), [Media](media.html), [Live Dates](live.html) and [Contact](contact.html). There is also a ['Hidden'](emailsuccess.html) Page that acts as an indication of succession upon completion of the contact form. These links are all within the navigation menu, in the header, on every page and gives clear indication on which page you're on by highlighting that particular page. 

# Design Choices #

## Typograghy ##

The choice of font was [Kulim Park](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kulim+Park) in regular 400. This is shown throughout the website. The Clean lines on the font and espeically in uppercase gives the sense of a clear cut and professional design choice. 

![Font](Readme_Img/readme_font.png)

## Colour Choices ##

The colour palette of the website is fairly simplistic with three main colours showing. The font simply being a soft dark grey and the main colour, shown in the header, footer and any other open space being a soft beige colour to tie in with a colour selection ripped from the album image - This helps highlight the image further and with the contrasting typograghy colouring, it really helps it stick out.

## Future features


- As this is a band page, it would need to be regularly updated with new imagery, dates and links.

# Testing


## Lighthouse


- During lighthouse testing the results are as follows;


## Lighthouse - Home Page ##


![Lighthouse homepage results](Readme_Img/electric_eden_readme_lighthouse_homepage.jpg)


- Performance marked down from 100. This is due to the img types. I know now that using .WebP would be a more efficient image source to use and can do this moving forward.
- 100% all other aspects.  

[Back to top](<#content>)
<hr>

## Lighthouse - Media Page ##


![Lighthouse Media results](Readme_Img/electric_eden_readme_lighthouse_media.jpg)


- As expected from the homepage results, the performance has been hindered due to image file type. Something I will do in future is make sure the file type is the correct one.
- Accessibility is 100%.
- Best practice is for one image aspect ratio - Something I'll amend in future.

## Lighthouse - Live Dates ##


![Lighthouse Live Date results](Readme_Img/electric_eden_readme_lighthouse_livedate.jpg)


- Same issue above with the logo being a .png file.
- Interesting SEO considered 'More Info' to not be specific to what the user will be clicking - Which I disagree with.
- The user will clearly click on that link to find out more information about that particular event.

[Back to top](<#content>)
<hr>

## Lighthouse - Contact ##


![Lighthouse Live Date results](Readme_Img/electric_eden_readme_lighthouse_contact.jpg)


- Contact form is good across the board. Aside from the consistent performance issue with the images.
